        <li><h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG)">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG)</a></h3></li>
        <p>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG, also known as PUBG: Battlegrounds) is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation,
           a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters.
           The last player or team standing wins the round.</p>
        <li><h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League of legends">League of Legends</a></h3></li>
        <p>League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games.
            Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, the game has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization.
            The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.</p>
        <li><h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearthstone">Hearthstone</a></h3></li>
        <p>Hearthstone is a free-to-play online digital collectible card game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. Originally subtitled Heroes of Warcraft,
            Hearthstone builds upon the existing lore of the Warcraft series by using the same elements, characters, and relics. It was first released for Microsoft Windows and macOS in March 2014, with ports for iOS and Android releasing later that year.
            The game features cross-platform play, allowing players on any supported device to compete with one another, restricted only by geographical region account limits.</p>
